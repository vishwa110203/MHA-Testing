# MHA-Testing

This is a project made to test the efficiency of some MHAs(meta-heuristic algorithms) for combinatorial optimization problems. The problem chosen here is a Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP) with 51 cities.
The three algorithms implemented are Genetic Algorithm(GA), Ant-Colony Optimization(ACO), and Gray-Wolf optimization(GWO). We can run these algorithms and obtain Fitness vs Generation graphs and time complexity to analyze which algorithm is suitable for our problem.
